# Finite Element Method in time-harmonic linear Acoustics: comparison and numerical performance

These Jupyter files correspond to the scripts for the supervised practical exercises for the **WAVES Summer School 2025** in Gandia

Jupyter notebooks are free to use, share, and modify.
See the license and copyright details described below.

## View and Run

Copies of these Jupyter files are hosted on the cloud service provided by
Folder, in the **notebooks** folder, accessible from the following link:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/maprieto/WAVES-Summer-School-2025/HEAD)
They can also be run using the Google Colabs cloud service: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maprieto/WAVES-Summer-School-2025/)

For a better experience, it is recommended to download or clone (using the 'clone' option) the full Github project to use these files in a local Jupyter environment.

## Getting Started

Each Jupyter Notebook explores a different Finite Element Discretization using NGSolve.
